Problem : - Our school did not have a ATL NSSN Website
Solution : So we decided to develop an ATL Website.

Anand: But wait, there's more! We made a timeline showing all the awesome things happening in our ATL Lab from the very start.

Aditya: So, why did we do this? Easy – there was no online home for our amazing ATL Lab.

Pranay: We wanted an online space that tells the story of our lab – the cool ideas, fun events, and the journey of creating stuff.

[Show snippets of the team proud of their creation]

Anand: Because every project deserves some spotlight, right?

[Closing scene with the team smiling]

Aditya: Come along with us on this online adventure. Explore, try out new things, and be part of the Navyug ATL Lab story.

Pranay: Keep an eye out, because there's always something new happening!
